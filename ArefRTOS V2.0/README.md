# ArefRTOS - A Self-Made Real-Time Operating System (Version 2.0)üë®‚Äçüíª

## Introduction üåü

Welcome to ArefRTOS, a real-time operating system (RTOS) meticulously crafted from scratch. This README provides an overview of key features and functionalities within ArefRTOS Version 2.0.

## Features Included by the Scheduler üöÄ

### 01. ArefRTOS SVC Handler

The `ArefRTOS SVC Handler` function is responsible for handling specific SVC calls related to task activation and termination in a real-time operating system. It involves a two-stage scheduling and dispatching process and potentially triggers a context switch using the PendSV exception.

#### Function Explanation

1. **Extracting SVC Parameter**: The function begins by extracting a single byte (`SVCParameter`) from the stack frame. This byte is obtained by casting a pointer to `svc_args[6]` (which points to the R1 register) as a `uint8_t*` and then subtracting 2 from it.

2. **Switch Statement**: It enters a `switch` statement based on the value of `SVCParameter`.

3. **Case: ArefRTOS_SVC_CALL_ACTIVATE_TASK**:
   - 3.1. Calls `ArefRTOS_voidFirstStageScheduler()` to decide which task to execute next based on priority.
   - 3.2. Checks if the OS is in the running state. If it is, it proceeds with additional steps.
   - 3.3. Calls `ArefRTOS_voidSecondStageDispatcher()` to switch the CPU from one process to another, saving and restoring the state of each process.
   - 3.4. Triggers a PendSV (Pendable Supervisor Call) exception, which is often used in context switching routines in RTOS implementations.

4. **Case: ArefRTOS_SVC_CALL_TERMINATE_TASK**:
   - 4.1. Performs the same steps as in the `ArefRTOS_SVC_CALL_ACTIVATE_TASK` case.

5. **Default Case**: Handles unknown SVC calls by taking no action.

### 02. ArefRTOS First Stage Scheduler

This function, `ArefRTOS_voidFirstStageScheduler()`, is a crucial part of the task scheduling process in the ArefRTOS real-time operating system (RTOS). It ensures that tasks are placed in the ready queue in the correct order based on their priorities, enabling efficient task execution in the RTOS.

#### Function Explanation

1. **Create Local Variables**: Initializes temporary local variables for task management.

2. **Sort Tasks**: Calls `ArefRTOS_voidBubbleSort()` to sort tasks in the task table based on priority.

3. **Select Current and Next Task**:
   - 3.1. **Free Ready Queue**: Clears the ready queue by repeatedly dequeuing tasks until it's empty.
   - 3.2. **Update Ready Queue**: Updates the ready queue based on task priorities:

     - 3.2.1. **Check Priority Options**:
       - 3.2.1.1. **End of Task Table**: If at the end of the task table, enqueues the current task, sets its state to ready, and exits.
       - 3.2.1.2. **Lower Priority Task**: If the current task has a lower priority than the next task, enqueues the current task, sets its state to ready, and exits.
       - 3.2.1.3. **Same Priority Tasks (Round-Robin)**: If the current task has the same priority as the next task, enqueues the current task for round-robin scheduling and continues without breaking.
       - 3.2.1.4. **Higher Priority Task**: If the current task has a higher priority than the next task, this is not allowed, and the loop exits.

### 03. ArefRTOS Second Stage Dispatcher

The `ArefRTOS_voidSecondStageDispatcher` function plays a crucial role in the task scheduling process within the ArefRTOS real-time operating system (RTOS). It manages the selection of the current and next tasks to be executed, ensuring smooth task execution and handling scenarios when there are no ready tasks.

#### Function Explanation

1. **Create Local Variables**: The function initializes temporary local variables to facilitate task management.
   
3. **Select Current and Next Task**:
   - 3.1. **Empty Queue and Non-Suspended Current Task**:
     - If the ready task queue is empty and the current task is not suspended:
       - The current task is set to a running state.
       - The current task is added back to the end of the ready task queue.
       - The next task is set to be the same as the current task.

   - 3.2. **Ready Queue is Not Empty**:
     - If the ready task queue is not empty:
       - The first task in the FIFO, `LOC_currentTask`, is dequeued and assigned.
       - The next task is set to `LOC_currentTask`.
       - `LOC_currentTask` is marked as running.
       - If the current task and the next task have the same priority, and the current task is not suspended, round-robin scheduling is applied:
         - The current task is added back to the end of the ready task queue.
         - The current task is marked as ready.


### 04. PendSV Handler for Context Switching

The `PendSV_Handler` function is responsible for handling context switches between tasks in the ArefRTOS real-time operating system (RTOS). This function ensures that tasks are executed smoothly and efficiently, maintaining their states during the switch.

#### Function Explanation

1. **Enter Critical Section**:
   - Disable interrupts (`CPSID i`) to ensure that the context switch is atomic and not interrupted by other tasks or interrupts.

2. **Save Current Context of the Current Task**:
   - Save xPSR, PC, LR, R12, R3, R2, R1, R0 into the current task's Process Stack Pointer (PSP).

3. **Save Rest of Registers of Current Task**:
   - Manually push the values of R4 to R11 onto the current task's PSP.
   - Decrease the PSP by one for each register.

4. **Switch Control to the Next Task's Process Stack**:
   - If there is a next task (`OS_nextTask` is not NULL), update `OS_currentTask` to point to the next task and reset `OS_nextTask`.

5. **Restore the Rest of Registers from the New Task's Process Stack**:
   - Manually pop the values of R4 to R11 from the new task's PSP.
   - Increase the PSP by one for each register.

6. **Update CPU PSP to Point to New Task's PSP**:
   - Set the CPU's PSP to point to the new task's PSP, making it the active stack for the CPU.

7. **Enable IRQ and Exit the Critical Section**:
   - Re-enable interrupts (`CPSIE i`) to allow other interrupts to be serviced.

8. **Switch Control to the Next Task and Exit**:
   - Perform a context switch by branching to the link register (LR) value saved during the context switch (`BX LR`), effectively resuming execution of the next task.
